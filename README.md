<text><center><strong>Read Manga directly on your screen</strong></center></text>

This project is real-time application that can OCR your screen and detect text in page of your manga.

## Demo


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b693bc5-8470-48cb-8f22-1a31f5d85b84

## Key Combination Usage
- <code>`</code> (*Key Code: 192*) : detect and translate again
- `Shift` + <code>`</code> : Clear screen
- `Ctrl` + `Alt` : Quit
- `Shift` + `W`: Get specific area of your screen to translate

## How to use
Wait until your terminal show `OCR ready` then press <code>`</code> to start (Re-press if it not detect and show translation)

## Installation
You can install and run (and modify) with these steps:
- Step 1: Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Yamakaze-chan/MangaLens.git
```
- Step 2: Change working directory
```
cd MangaLens
```
- Step 3: Install require packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Step 4: Download YOLO weight
```
git clone https://huggingface.co/Yamakaze/MangaLens  
```
- Step 5: create `.env` file
```
cd . > .env
```
- Step 6: Open `.env` and add this
```
#Yolo weight
YOLO_weight = MangaLens/best2.pt

#MangaOCR weight
MangaOCR_weight = ""

#Translation pretrained models
ja_en_weight = Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-ja-en
ja_en_token = Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-ja-en
zh_en_weight = Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-zh-en
zh_en_token = Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-zh-en
en_vi_weight = vinai/vinai-translate-en2vi-v2
en_vi_token = vinai/vinai-translate-en2vi-v2
```
- Step 7: Run and enjoy
```
python app.py
```
## Models
If you see this project is useful, don't forget to give star to these projects
- [YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics): I am using v12 (because It's new and I want to try it :smiley: )
- [manga-ocr](https://github.com/kha-white/manga-ocr): To read text from image
- [OPUS-MT](https://github.com/Helsinki-NLP/Opus-MT): translate offline and fast
- [Lingua](https://github.com/pemistahl/lingua-py): Detect text language to pick translator
- **This project**: Why not? :smiley:

## Convert to desktop app
You can convert to desktop app with **PyInstaller**   
- [Document](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/)   
- [Install](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/)   
In case you want to work with GUI instead of command line, [Auto PY to EXE](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/) is my suggestion.
